# Matrix Mortality Frontier Campaign

Established-result ledger and dimension-two research audit: 2026-07-24. A question mark means
“not resolved by any valid result found in the present literature audit,” not an assertion that
no unpublished argument exists.

## The source theorem

The source result is no longer conditional on the Neary–Rote terminal tile:

> **Theorem.** `GPCP(4)` over a binary target alphabet is undecidable, even with empty left
> boundaries, one empty right boundary, and nonempty morphism images.

For Neary's four ordinary pairs, the fixed-boundary equation is

```text
∃w ∈ {R_c,R_b,D_c,D_b}*: U(w)10^β = V(w).
```

A zero-run automaton forces every matching word into exact deletion-width blocks, and a
queue-history theorem proves that those blocks constitute a lawful restricted tag computation.
Conversely, every halting computation emits such a match. This equivalence is formalized in
`MatrixMortality/NearyEncoding.lean`; only Neary's Lemma 9 universality compiler remains an
external published theorem.

Adding a fresh delimiter pair `(10^β#, #)` and fixed-length binary recoding also gives a
corrected five-pair PCP family with primitive terminality. Rote's long unary guard is no longer
used.

Nicolas (2008) and CHHN (2014) explicitly list `GPCP(4)` as open. Exact-phrase searches,
forward-citation inspection of Neary's paper, and inspection of Rote's 2024/2025 versions found
no later statement of this consequence. Rote notices the special terminal role but does not
state the bounded-GPCP improvement. This is a strong novelty indication, not an absolute
bibliographic certificate; author confirmation is mandatory before priority language is used.

## Cross-problem consequences

The source representation, paired-role quotient, and shared-channel binary compiler establish
the Pareto-minimal scalar points

```text
Z₃(4), Z₄(3), Z₆(2).
```

CHHN's scalar-to-corner reduction gives

```text
R₃(5), R₄(4), R₅(3), R₇(2).
```

The structured forms `Z̊₃(4)`, `Z̊₄(3)`, and `Z̊₆(2)` have common first column `e₁`. The
six-state binary compiler supersedes the earlier `Z₇(2)` packing consequence; its corner lift
similarly supersedes `R₈(2)`.

## The reusable compiler

The rank-one construction is best viewed as a fixed-boundary compiler. Let `ρ` be a matrix
representation whose letter matrices are nonsingular, and consider

```text
ℓᵀ P ρ(w) S c = 0,
```

where `P,S` encode fixed left and right words. Put

```text
a = (S c)(ℓᵀ P).
```

Then

```text
a ρ(w) a = (S c) [ℓᵀ P ρ(w) S c] (ℓᵀ P).
```

In an arbitrary product, nonsingularity of the `ρ`-blocks makes the two exterior vectors
nonzero; the product vanishes exactly when one internal bridge scalar vanishes. Both fixed
boundaries therefore cost one repeated rank-one generator, not two boundary generators.

This subsumes terminal-tile absorption and the older Claus endpoint construction. Its counting
law is the important limitation:

```text
m active interior tile roles  +  one rank-one separator
                         =  m+1 mortality generators.
```

Boundary-only tiles are free; an interior-active tile is not. Neary's tile 5 is boundary-only,
but tiles 1–4 all remain active. Tile 1 is forced first yet also recurs during the simulation, so
absorbing the initial occurrence does not reduce the active alphabet. Consequently this compiler
is exhausted at `M₃(5)`. Reaching `M₃(4)` by the same route requires a source with at most three
interior roles, equivalently an undecidable `GPCP(3)` family.

## The paired-role compiler

In the side-normal word-pair representation, Neary's rule and erasure matrix for a fixed tag
letter agree on the two-dimensional upper-word plane. On two three-dimensional phase spaces,
the anti-diagonal copy of this plane can therefore be quotiented out. Two data generators and
one suffix-phase toggle act on the resulting four-dimensional space. Every control word decodes
to a four-role word, and every four-role word has an encoding.

This gives structured `Z̊₄(3)`. Adding the established outer-product separator gives `M₄(4)`;
the arbitrary-product converse uses the controls' common fixed column instead of nonsingularity.
The machine-checked implementation is in `PairedCompression.lean` and `PairedMortality.lean`.
A public-literature search through 2026-07-22 found no earlier `Z₄(3)`, `M₄(4)`, paired-role
decoder, or common-column mortality converse. The quotient itself and the rank-one separator
are prior art; see `audits/m44-prior-art-2026-07-22.md`.

## The binary compilers

The four-role alphabet factors as a rule/deletion bit and a tag-letter bit. A two-bit decoder
therefore needs one complete three-coordinate state and one partial state. Rule and deletion
share the partial upper channel, reducing the generic partial state to three coordinates. The
resulting two `6×6` integer matrices preserve the source coefficient on every binary word; an
odd final bit preserves the coefficient, and reversed block encoding is surjective. Transpose
and word reversal give structured `Z̊₆(2)`.

Full mortality requires coding the four payloads and the rank-one separator. The complete
prefix code

```text
0, 100, 101, 110, 111
```

has four prefix states and gives a `12`-state deterministic matrix transducer. The word `00`
synchronizes all start states. Paired-role agreement supplies two common left annihilators, so
both binary generators have image in one integral `10`-dimensional subspace. Restriction to that
image is exact. If a restricted product is zero, appending `0` gives a zero `12`-state product;
restriction therefore introduces no false mortality witness. This proves `M₁₀(2)`, and zero
padding gives `M_d(2)` for every `d≥10`.

Both compilers and their arbitrary-word converses are machine-checked in `PairedBinary.lean`,
`WeightedTransducer.lean`, and `PrefixMortality.lean`. A public-literature search through
2026-07-24 found no earlier `Z₆(2)`, `R₇(2)`, or `M₁₀(2)`. Binary coding and generic alphabet
reduction are prior art; the priority claims concern the shared-channel and common-image
constructions.

## Current mortality staircase

After terminal absorption, paired-role compression, binary compilation, dimension padding, and
CHHN's generator–dimension trade, the established Pareto-minimal undecidable points are

```text
M₃(5), M₄(4), M₆(3), M₁₀(2).
```

The unknown cells immediately below this staircase are:

| Cell | What would suffice | Automatic reward |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `M₃(4)` | three-active-role fixed-boundary PCP / `GPCP(3)`, or a new same-dimension generator compiler | by CHHN, also `M₉(2)` |
| `M₅(3)` | shave one state from the specialized `M₃(5) → M₆(3)` packing | supersedes `M₆(3)` |
| `M₉(2)` | a zero-set-preserving compiler not obtained by restricting the exact ten-state binary decoder | improves the two-generator threshold by one |
| `M₂(k≥3)` | a qualitatively different decidability or undecidability argument | settles the dimension-two wall |

The scalar result `Z₆(2)` gives `M₆(3)` after adjoining a separator; that mortality point was
already obtained from `M₃(5)` by CHHN packing.

## Ranked attacks

### 1. Rank-one-aware packing: `M₅(3)`

CHHN's generic `h=2,k=2` construction maps five `3×3` generators to three `6×6`
generators. Our five matrices are exceptional: four are nonsingular PCP matrices fixing `e₁`,
and one is rank one. The target is a five-dimensional reachable/observable realization of this
special packed semigroup.

The literal packing has no codimension-one letterwise reduction. For every placement of the
rank-one separator and four ordinary generators, the three packed `6×6` matrices have neither a
common invariant line nor a common invariant hyperplane. Thus no simultaneous similarity followed
by a five-dimensional restriction or quotient can work. This does not exclude a different
representation preserving only the scalar zero language.

The next finite test is a Hankel-rank certificate for the scalar series realized by the packed
system: six prefixes and six suffixes whose `6×6` pairing minor is nonzero. Such a certificate
would rule out every exact five-state weighted-automaton realization of that series, though not a
different series with the same zero set. A successful mortality reduction must alter the word
code, treat the separator as punctuation, or prove malformed-word nonvanishing by a separate
normal form.

### 2. Two-generator realization: `M₉(2)`

The complete prefix decoder has a common image of dimension exactly ten for the present source:
its common left annihilator has dimension two, and the restricted pair has no common right
kernel. No further image restriction or kernel quotient of this decoder reaches nine states.

The surviving route may preserve only the zero set. It must use a different transducer
skeleton, change nonzero values, or exploit a source identity beyond paired upper-channel
agreement. A literal binary prefix tree for five source symbols has four internal states, so a
nine-state construction cannot retain a complete three-dimensional source state at every
prefix.

### 3. Source-role compression: `M₃(4)`

This is the highest-value and least incremental target. Neary's four active roles are:

```text
tile 1: initialization and the c-rule,
tile 2: the b-rule,
tile 3: deletion of b,
tile 4: deletion of c.
```

A three-role source could arise by making one deletion implicit, macro-encoding a whole
deletion phase, or replacing the binary tag source by a computational model whose desynchronized
simulation needs only three interior morphism letters. Any such result is essentially a proof of
`GPCP(3)` undecidability and would be a substantial theorem in its own right.

Halava and Holub's reduction-tree analysis at the decidable `GPCP(2)` endpoint gives a second
route to examine: characterize which three-letter instances reduce to binary successors, then
search for an invariant obstruction in the corrected Neary family. This will not prove
undecidability by itself, but it replaces blind tile algebra with the established language of
beginning blocks, end blocks, successors, and suffix complexity.

The fixed-first property alone does not help: tile 1 recurs internally. Apparent word-factor
relations between tiles 2–4 must be checked against arbitrary concatenations; local equality of
one side is not enough and is a prolific source of spurious solutions.

## The dimension-two wall: `M₂(3)`

### Status and exact hard core

The public-literature audit through 2026-07-24 found neither a decision algorithm nor an
undecidability proof for `M₂(3)`. The case is equivalent to point-to-point reachability on
`P¹(ℚ)` under two rational Möbius transformations.

Let `X₁⋯Xₙ=0` be a mortal word of minimal positive length over `2×2` matrices. Its first and
last factors are singular: an invertible endpoint could be cancelled. Every interior factor is
nonsingular. Indeed, if an interior factor is `uvᵀ`, then

```text
0 = P(uvᵀ)Q = (Pu)(vᵀQ)
```

forces either `Puvᵀ=0` or `uvᵀQ=0`, producing a shorter mortal word.

For an input of at most three matrices this leaves one unresolved rank pattern: two
nonsingular matrices `A,B` and one nonzero singular matrix `R=cr`. Every minimal witness then
has the form

```text
R W R,       W ∈ {A,B}*,
```

and

```text
R W R = c(rWc)r.
```

Consequently,

```text
M₂(3)  ≡  given A,B ∈ GL₂(ℚ), r≠0, c≠0, decide ∃W∈{A,B}*: rWc=0.
```

After projectivization this asks whether the submonoid generated by `A,B` sends `[c]` to
`P(ker r)`. If `rc=0`, the empty interior already gives `R²=0`; otherwise a rational change of
basis turns the condition into a zero in one fixed matrix corner. Clearing denominators and
independently rescaling the three generators preserves zero products, so the rational incidence
problem and integer mortality are computably interreducible.

The reduction has only one incidence instance. Multiple endpoint pairs arise for larger
families with several singular generators, not in the hard three-generator case.

### Established and provisional decidable strata

The status labels below are deliberate:

- **established**: peer-reviewed result represented in the local bibliography;
- **preprint**: public unrefereed theorem;
- **checked derivation**: elementary reduction independently checked in this project;
- **provisional**: a new argument supplied by the 2026-07-24 audit, requiring separate proof
  and source review before publication use.

| Stratum | Status | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Two total `2×2` generators | established | Bournez–Branicky low-dimensional mortality algorithm |
| Any finite family with at most one nonsingular generator | preprint | rank-one endpoints and order-two recurrence zero tests |
| Nonsingular integer generators in `GL₂(ℤ)`, with arbitrary singular generators | established | effective regular subsets of `GL₂(ℤ)` |
| Two projectively unimodular nonsingular generators | checked derivation from established work | primitive representatives lie in `GL₂(ℤ)` |
| Fixed nonsingular matrix membership | established, but insufficient | determinant growth plus `GL₂(ℤ)` automata |
| A generated projective group preserving a two-point set | provisional | rational subsets of an effectively finitely generated abelian-by-`C₂` group |
| Common rational invariant line with integral affine multipliers | established reduction to published affine reachability | one-dimensional integer-affine reachability |
| Common rational multiplier, including regular control | provisional | exact finite discounted-sum reachability |
| Multipliers that are positive powers of one rational base | provisional | fixed-block reduction to the common-multiplier case |
| A single-base affine group `G_q^±` with arbitrary rational control | provisional | rational-subset intersection in `BS(1,q)` and its index-two extension |

Simultaneous triangularization alone is not a solved stratum. It yields rational affine
reachability

```text
z ↦ a_i z+b_i,
```

whose general two-map case remains part of the wall. The provisional common-multiplier and
single-base theorems cover substantial subfamilies but do not settle mixed multiplicative
directions.

### Exact unresolved residue

Two qualitatively different classes remain after the preceding tests.

#### Mixed-prime affine systems

These have a common rational fixed point but genuinely independent multiplier valuations, for
example

```text
z ↦ (2/3)z+1,       z ↦ (3/5)z+1.
```

The slopes are neither integral, equal, powers of one rational base, nor elements of one
`{±qⁿ}` group. This is already a two-map, one-dimensional, virtually solvable residue.

#### Non-elementary projective systems

Here the generators have no common rational eigenline and preserve no unordered pair of
projective points. They are not projectively unimodular and need not generate a free monoid.
The problem becomes intersection of the positive rational subset

```text
⟨A,B⟩⁺
```

with a rational parabolic coset carrying the source point to the target.

These two residues should be attacked separately. A theorem for the affine class need not
touch the non-elementary case.

### False shortcuts

| Temptation | Failure |
| --- | --- |
| Apply fixed-target matrix membership | the incidence variety contains matrices of unbounded determinant |
| Invoke flat rational-subset algorithms | `(A+B)*` permits unbounded alternation and need not be flat |
| Declare triangular systems decidable | rational affine reachability remains unresolved outside special strata |
| Treat arbitrary words as one recurrence | word order is stored by a two-state rational series, not one exponent |
| Use a free subgroup normal form | the input generators may satisfy relations such as `A³=B²` |
| Import the standard PCP encoding | two independent free-word tapes do not embed in `2×2` complex matrices |
| Track only determinant or Smith form | equal arithmetic invariants can have different projective orbits |
| Assume projective height descends | determinant-growing words may act projectively as the identity |

These are exclusion tests for future proposals. Any attack relying on one of them must identify
the additional hypothesis that repairs the failure.

### Pre-mortem: imported structural principles

The following is a research-prior allocation, not evidence for either outcome. Condition on
`M₂(3)` being resolved by an imported structural theorem rather than a local extension of
mortality machinery:

```text
Pr(decidable | imported resolution)   ≈ 0.80
Pr(undecidable | imported resolution) ≈ 0.20.
```

| Primary source of the decisive lemma | Credence | Outcome allocation |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `S`-arithmetic geometry, Bruhat–Tits trees, reduction theory | 21% | 20% decidable, 1% undecidable |
| Numeration systems, continued fractions, finite-state transducers | 17% | 12% decidable, 5% undecidable |
| Metabelian groups, Laurent modules, `S`-unit equations | 15% | 13% decidable, 2% undecidable |
| Rational subsets, Bass–Serre theory, parabolic-coset algorithms | 12% | 10% decidable, 2% undecidable |
| `SL₂` trace algebras, character varieties, Markoff descent | 9% | 8% decidable, 1% undecidable |
| Arithmetic dynamics, height gaps, Subspace-Theorem methods | 8% | 7% decidable, 1% undecidable |
| Verification, well-structured systems, affine-loop acceleration | 6% | 5% decidable, 1% undecidable |
| Profinite topology, congruence separation, automatic structures | 5% | 5% decidable |
| FRACTRAN, Collatz systems, automaton-semigroup universality | 6% | 6% undecidable |
| Other structural sources | 1% | predominantly undecidable |

The percentages are coarse hypothesis weights. They are intended to force diversity in the
next prompt battery, not to rank theorem credibility.

### Independent attack lanes

Dispatch each lane as a standalone investigation. It must conduct its own deep literature
review, attack the full incidence problem rather than merely survey it, state the strongest
proved import it finds, and identify an explicit falsifier for its proposed mechanism. Synthesis
comes only after the independent reports return; shared vocabulary must not collapse genuinely
different hypotheses into one generic prompt.

#### 1. Adelic parabolic reduction

Let `S` be the primes appearing in denominators and nonunit determinants. Study the simultaneous
action on the real hyperbolic plane and the Bruhat–Tits trees `T_p`, `p∈S`. The desired theorem
is an effective finite cone-type decomposition relative to a rational parabolic, with the
unbounded part carried by decidable Busemann counters. The critical obstruction is
synchronization across several primes.

The first falsifier is a pair whose simultaneous Busemann coordinates simulate an unrestricted
two-counter system. The first positive certificate is a bounded-cancellation or induction
theorem reducing one bad prime at a time.

#### 2. Redundant projective numeration

Represent rational points by continued fractions, Stern–Brocot addresses, or redundant
signed `S`-adic expansions. Search for a representation in which both Möbius generators have a
common finite carry nucleus. Canonical expansions are not privileged; the single-base pointed
expansion for `BS(1,q)` is evidence that annotation can turn nonregular arithmetic into a
regular language.

The decisive experiment is to compare reachable carry-state growth for ordinary continued
fractions, slow continued fractions, Stern–Brocot paths, and redundant multi-prime expansions.

#### 3. Characteristic-zero affine modules

For triangular systems, express the translation component as a module element over the
multiplicative slope group. The target theorem is decidability of cyclic-coset reachability in
a rank-one characteristic-zero module-by-abelian group generated by two affine maps. Minimal
`S`-unit relations, Laurent-module normal forms, or effective semilinearity are the likely
invariants.

The mixed-prime pair `(2/3,3/5)` is the benchmark. A method that cannot decide it has not crossed
the affine residue.

#### 4. Rational subsets and relative normal forms

Seek an algorithm deciding intersection of a positive rational subset of a two-generated
subgroup of `PGL₂(ℚ)` with a rational parabolic coset. Candidate imports are Bass–Serre
decompositions, relative automatic structures, and rational-subset closure theorems for graphs
of groups with affine edge or vertex groups.

This lane should target arbitrary regular control languages. Success only for bounded
alternation reproduces the existing flat theory.

#### 5. Trace or height descent

Exploit the dimension-four algebra generated by two `2×2` matrices, Fricke trace identities,
and Nielsen transformations. Enlarge trace data by the boundary coefficients

```text
rc, rAc, rBc, rABc
```

and search for a mutation or height that strictly descends for every minimal zero word outside
an elementary locus. Arithmetic-dynamics variants may instead prove a computable bound on
normal-form length.

Raw word length is not a lawful height: relations can make long words represent short group
elements.

#### 6. Exact symbolic saturation and finite obstructions

Run backward saturation from the target using cones, valuation vectors, residue classes, and
affine lattices. A successful well-structured formulation must decide exact reachability, not
only coverability. In parallel, test whether no-instances are separated by a finite congruence
quotient. Congruence separation would provide enumerable finite certificates for “no.”

Persistent local-global failures modulo every tested modulus would falsify the profinite route.

#### 7. Valuation universality

For undecidability, encode configurations in prime valuations or disjoint `p`-adic cylinders.
The two Möbius generators must be total, so illegal instructions require irreversible geometric
traps rather than external guards. A valid proposal must include the arbitrary-word converse:
every accidental incidence must decode to a legal computation.

Single-base affine encodings and common-multiplier digit systems are excluded by the decidable
strata above. A plausible construction must use mixed valuation directions or a non-elementary
projective action.

### Discriminating signals

- Arbitrary regular control favors rational subsets, buildings, numeration, or module automata.
- A theorem for any finite generator set favors adelic or automatic structure over
  two-letter combinatorics.
- Semilinear no-certificates favor affine modules or verification.
- Finite-modulus no-certificates favor profinite separation.
- A computable witness bound favors height, Diophantine, or trace descent.
- A virtually-solvable/non-elementary dichotomy favors arithmetic dynamics.
- An undecidability construction with several prime determinants favors valuation storage.

The highest-value intersection is

```text
S-arithmetic parabolics
+ annotated numeration systems
+ rational-subset automata.
```

The concrete question is whether the pointed-expansion phenomenon for one affine base extends
to a synchronized finite family of primes, or whether that synchronization already supports
universal computation.

## Execution order

1. Formalize the all-placement packing obstruction and extract a symbolic Hankel-rank
   certificate for the standard `M₃(5) → M₆(3)` representation.
2. Search for zero-set-preserving representations for `M₅(3)` and `M₉(2)` rather than another
   invariant restriction of the exact six- or ten-state compilers.
3. Attack `GPCP(3)` at the source level, beginning with a complete role/dependency graph of the
   corrected Neary simulation rather than ad hoc tile algebra.
4. Fan the `M₂(3)` chapter into independent attacks on adelic cone types, redundant
   numeration, characteristic-zero affine modules, parabolic rational subsets, trace/height
   descent, finite-obstruction saturation, and valuation universality.
5. Synthesize the returned attacks by the discriminating signals above; do not average
   incompatible hypotheses into one generic mortality prompt.

These are research programs, not consequences of the present theorem.

# Salvage Theorem Registry

This file is the canonical index of reusable results obtained while an attack failed to settle
its target. `FRONTIER.md` owns strategy; `FORMALIZATION.md` owns Lean coverage; `audits/` own
bounded reviews. Raw prompts and undigested Pro reports are not repository artifacts.

## Record Contract

Every record has a stable identifier and five core fields:

- **kind**: compiler, obstruction, structure theorem, decidable stratum, certificate, or partial
  mechanism;
- **evidence**: `reported`, `audited`, `formalized`, or `computational`;
- **disposition**: `stock`, `active`, `closed`, `parked`, or `graduated`;
- **scope**: the exact hypotheses and conclusions that may be reused;
- **use**: the attack or proof obligation for which the result is operational;

Every active record also states the next promotion step. A graduated record instead cites its
formal artifact.

The first namespace component identifies the campaign: `MM` for general matrix-mortality
compilers and `D2` for the dimension-two wall. The second component identifies the result
class: `C` compiler, `O` obstruction, `M` partial mechanism, `S` structure theorem, or `D`
decidable stratum. Numbers never change after assignment.

`reported` means that the result survives only as a contracted statement from an external
review. It cannot support a publication claim. `audited` means that its proof has been checked
independently in this project. `formalized` means that the cited Lean declaration passes the
strict gate. `computational` never licenses an unbounded theorem.

`stock` is ready for reuse without scheduled promotion. `active` has a live use or promotion
task. `parked` remains valid but lacks a current route to its target. `graduated` has entered the
formal corpus. `closed` is retained only as a warning after refutation or strict subsumption.

Agents should cite record identifiers in research prompts and frontier updates. A prompt must
carry the record's scope, not merely its conclusion. A reusable result without enough statement
or construction to recover its use does not belong here. GitHub issues own scheduled work; this
file owns the mathematical stock.

## Matrix Mortality

### MM-C01: Fixed-anchor rank-one compiler

**Kind:** compiler  
**Evidence:** formalized  
**Disposition:** graduated

Let every active matrix `X_a` fix a nonzero column `e`, let `Le ≠ 0`, and put `P = CL`. Then the
family `{X_a} ∪ {P}` is mortal exactly when `LX_wC = 0` for some active word `w`. The converse
fractures every arbitrary product at every occurrence of `P`; the fixed column replaces
invertibility at the exterior row.

**Scope:** empty internal blocks are harmless only when `LC ≠ 0`; the theorem does not make the
scalar source undecidable.

**Artifact:** `MatrixMortality.fixedAnchor_mortal_adjoin_outer_iff` in
[`TerminalTile.lean`](MatrixMortality/TerminalTile.lean).

**Use:** prefer this theorem to a bespoke separator argument whenever a common fixed column is
available.

### MM-C02: Common-image restriction

**Kind:** compiler  
**Evidence:** formalized  
**Disposition:** graduated

Suppose every generator maps the ambient space into a common subspace `K`, and explicit integral
maps `J : K → V` and `Q : V → K` satisfy `QJ = I` and `A_iJ = JB_i`. Mortality of the restricted
family follows from mortality upstairs. Conversely, if `B_w = 0`, then `A_w` kills `K`; appending
any generator whose image lies in `K` gives a zero ambient product.

**Scope:** the appended-letter converse is required. Restriction alone may introduce zero
products absent from the ambient family.

**Artifact:** `MatrixMortality.isMortal_commonImage_iff` and
`MatrixMortality.restrictedPrefixGenerator_mortal_iff_prefixMachine` in
[`MatrixSemigroup.lean`](MatrixMortality/MatrixSemigroup.lean) and
[`PrefixMortality.lean`](MatrixMortality/PrefixMortality.lean).

**Use:** this is the reusable core of the `12 → 10` binary mortality compiler.

### MM-O01: All-placement packing rank

**Kind:** obstruction  
**Evidence:** reported  
**Disposition:** active

For every placement of the four ordinary `3 × 3` payloads and the rank-one separator in the
literal three-generator `6 × 6` CHHN packing, the selected scalar coefficient series reportedly
has Hankel rank exactly six. The report supplies six-prefix and six-suffix determinant
certificates for the three separator-location cases.

**Scope:** this excludes exact five-state realizations of that coefficient series. It does not
exclude a different five-state series with the same zero set.

**Use:** reject further exact minimization of the literal CHHN packing and require a changed
coefficient series or punctuation architecture.

**Artifact:** the claim and its prior-art scope are preserved in
[`audits/m44-prior-art-2026-07-22.md`](audits/m44-prior-art-2026-07-22.md#7-the-chhn-packing-and-the-hankel-rank-six-obstruction).
The symbolic proof has not been independently reconstructed in Lean.

**Next:** audit the determinant families, then formalize one placement-independent finite
certificate.

**Issue:** [#3, Formalize the exact-realization obstructions for
`M₅(3)`](https://github.com/aoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoa/math/issues/3).

### MM-O02: One-sided phase overlap

**Kind:** obstruction  
**Evidence:** reported  
**Disposition:** parked

In the standard two-slot selector architecture, a common invariant line reportedly forces its
overlap vector into either the upper-word or lower-word invariant plane. The resulting bridge
depends on only one positional-value channel; after this forcing step, its zero language is
effectively regular.

**Scope:** the forcing statement concerns the stated common-line phase fusion, including its
projective rescalings. The regularity conclusion is conditional on the global mortality
converse reducing malformed words to finitely many such bridges. It is not a general
impossibility theorem for five-state zero-set representations.

**Use:** reject a proposed common-line selector only after matching all of its hypotheses.

**Artifact:** bibliographic scope is recorded in
[`audits/m44-prior-art-2026-07-22.md`](audits/m44-prior-art-2026-07-22.md#8-the-phase-fusion-obstruction-and-regular-positional-value-languages).

**Next:** recover and audit the forcing proof before using it to reject another architecture.

### MM-O03: Two-channel boundary tax

**Kind:** obstruction  
**Evidence:** audited  
**Disposition:** active

Let `A : Σ* → Mₙ(K)`, let `U=[u₀ u₁]` and `V=[v₀;v₁]` both have rank two, and suppose

```text
V A_w U = [[0,0],[0,h(w)]]
```

for every word `w`. If `h` has Hankel rank `d`, then `n ≥ d+2`.

Write `R = span{A_wu₁}` and `N = {x : v₁A_wx=0 for every w}`. The active realization has
dimension `dim R/(R∩N)=d`; the zero bridge entries give `u₀∈N` and `v₀R=0`. If `u₀∈R`, it adds
one unobservable reachable direction and `v₀` forces one complementary dimension. If `u₀∉R`,
the direct sum `R+Ku₀` is still annihilated by nonzero `v₀`. Both cases give `n≥d+2`.

**Scope:** exact diagonal two-channel identities only. Invertible row and column changes on the
two boundary channels preserve the conclusion. Same-zero series and off-diagonal bridges are
outside the theorem.

**Use:** with [`MM-O04`](#mm-o04-uniform-rank-four-paired-series), this closes every exact
five-state diagonal rank-two bridge for the paired scalar series.

**Next:** formalize the finite-dimensional statement without importing a general infinite
Hankel library.

**Issue:** [#3, Formalize the exact-realization obstructions for
`M₅(3)`](https://github.com/aoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoa/math/issues/3).

### MM-O04: Uniform rank-four paired series

**Kind:** certificate  
**Evidence:** audited  
**Disposition:** active

For every admissible deletion width and body, the scalar series

```text
h(w) = L G_w C,       w ∈ {b,c,t}*
```

of the explicit paired `4 × 4` controls has Hankel rank exactly four. The reachable
columns `C,G_bC,G_cC,TC` have determinant

```text
s(s−9)(5q−162e+6s−159)/6,
```

Here `s=3^(β+1)`, `q=3^(|tagEncode_β(body)|+3)`,
`e=σ(tagEncode_β(body))`, `B=(5s+1)/2`, and `A=2q/3+9e+7`.
The final factor is `3 mod 27`. The observable rows `L,LG_b,LG_bT,LG_c` have determinant

```text
24(B(A+1)−52) > 0.
```

**Scope:** exact coefficient series over characteristic zero. The result supplies no lower bound
for another series with the same zero set.

**Use:** proves exact minimality of paired-role compression and supplies `d=4` to
[`MM-O03`](#mm-o03-two-channel-boundary-tax).

**Next:** check the determinant identities in Lean and add their transitive axioms to the
publication snapshot.

**Issue:** [#3, Formalize the exact-realization obstructions for
`M₅(3)`](https://github.com/aoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoa/math/issues/3).

### MM-M01: Off-diagonal companion interface

**Kind:** partial mechanism  
**Evidence:** audited  
**Disposition:** stock

For `g(w)=λB_wd`, invertible `B_a`, and `α=λd≠0`, define

```text
J(x) = [[0,x],[1,0]].
```

In dimension `r+1`, put

```text
u₀ = e_{r+1},           u₁ = (d/α,0)ᵀ,
v₀ = (λ,0),             v₁ = e_{r+1}ᵀ,
U  = [u₀ u₁],           V  = [v₀;v₁],
E  = UV.
```

Then `rank E=2` and

```text
V diag(B_w,1) U = J(g(w)/α).
```

Products fracture at `E`, and a central product of `J` matrices can vanish only if a bridge
coefficient vanishes. Repeating one zero bridge twice gives `J(0)²=0`.

**Scope:** as a standalone scalar-to-mortality compiler this is dominated by the rank-one
separator `P=dλ`, which stays in dimension `r`. A four-state binary root would therefore prove
`M₄(3)`, not merely `M₅(3)`.

**Use:** retain `J` only as a target interface when punctuation must be represented by a word in
another generator rather than adjoined as its own generator.

**Next:** use the off-diagonal interface in the fused-toggle search; do not present it as a new
frontier reduction.

### MM-M02: Bordered toggle

**Kind:** partial mechanism  
**Evidence:** audited  
**Disposition:** parked

Choose a two-plane `F` in the `+1` eigenspace of the paired toggle, complete it by a third
`+1` eigenvector `g`, a `−1` eigenvector `h`, and a fifth vector `η`. In the basis
`(F,g,h,η)`, put

```text
S = I_F ⊕ K,             K = [[1,0,1],[0,−1,1],[−1/2,−1/2,0]].
```

Its upper-left four-dimensional block is the original toggle, and

```text
rank S = 4,     rank S² = 3,     S³ = Π_F,     rank Π_F = 2.
```

With data lifts `diag(G_x,0)`, every word containing no adjacent toggles has the original
four-dimensional control product as its upper-left block and is therefore nonzero. Maximal
toggle runs have three modes: `S`, `S²`, and `Π_F`.

**Scope:** mixed `S²` runs, malformed placements of `Π_F`, and the required rank-one or
off-diagonal selector are unresolved. Bounded searches on one benchmark do not establish an
impossibility theorem.

**Use:** a concrete architecture for fusing the toggle and separator into the third physical
generator of an `M₅(3)` family.

**Next:** parameterize the permitted fifth-coordinate couplings, solve the selector identities
symbolically, and prove a global maximal-run grammar or a symbolic no-go theorem.

## Dimension Two

### D2-S01: Projective hard core

**Kind:** structure theorem  
**Evidence:** audited  
**Disposition:** active

Every unresolved `M₂(3)` instance has two nonsingular generators `A,B` and one nonzero rank-one
generator `R=cr`. A minimal mortal word has the form `RWR`, and

```text
RWR = c(rWc)r.
```

Thus `M₂(3)` is computably equivalent to deciding whether `rWc=0` for some
`W∈{A,B}*`, equivalently point-to-point reachability on `P¹(ℚ)` under two rational Möbius
transformations.

**Scope:** the empty interior is allowed and gives `R²=0` exactly when `rc=0`. Larger generator
families may have several endpoint pairs; the three-generator hard core has one.

**Use:** every dimension-two attack should state which projective-incidence residue it decides
or encodes.

**Next:** formalize the minimal-word case split and rational-to-integer transport when the
dimension-two campaign enters its verification phase.

### D2-D01: Projectively unimodular stratum

**Kind:** decidable stratum  
**Evidence:** audited  
**Disposition:** stock

If primitive integral representatives of both projective generators have determinant `±1`,
point-to-point reachability is decidable by the established `GL₂(ℤ)` reachability machinery.
This includes rational scalar multiples of unimodular matrices.

**Scope:** it does not extend to arbitrary nonunit determinants.

**Use:** eliminate this stratum before invoking arithmetic dynamics or valuation storage.

### D2-D02: Invariant-pair stratum

**Kind:** decidable stratum  
**Evidence:** reported  
**Disposition:** active

If the generated projective group preserves an unordered pair of distinct algebraic points,
conjugation reduces it to multiplication and inversion in a finitely generated subgroup of a
number field of degree at most two. The report reduces rational point reachability to effective
semilinear membership in an abelian-by-`C₂` group.

**Scope:** the recognition algorithm and effective semilinearity require independent checking.
The claim does not cover a group with only one common fixed point.

**Use:** separate elementary projective groups from the non-elementary residue before invoking
height growth or valuation universality.

**Next:** audit the invariant-pair recognition cases and the positive-semigroup reachability
step.

### D2-D03: Common-multiplier stratum

**Kind:** decidable stratum  
**Evidence:** reported  
**Disposition:** active

For finitely many rational affine maps `z ↦ az+b_i` with one nonzero rational multiplier `a`,
rational endpoints, and regular control, the report reduces reachability to semilinear path
weights when `a=±1` and to corrected finite target discounted-sum reachability otherwise.
Fixed positive powers of one rational base reduce by regular block substitution.

**Scope:** the result depends on the corrected finite-word discounted-sum theorem. Different
multipliers with independent valuation vectors remain outside it.

**Use:** remove common-slope and common-positive-base affine candidates from the dimension-two
undecidability search.

**Next:** verify the corrected source theorem, reversal and final-letter constructions, and
negative-multiplier parity handling.

### D2-D04: Single-base affine stratum

**Kind:** decidable stratum  
**Evidence:** reported  
**Disposition:** active

For

```text
G_q^± = {z ↦ εqⁿz+t : ε∈{±1}, n∈ℤ, t∈ℤ[1/q]},
```

the report claims decidability of point incidence for every rational subset represented by a
finite automaton. It reduces the incidence set to a coset of an effectively cyclic stabilizer
and invokes Boolean emptiness for rational subsets of `BS(1,q)`, followed by an index-two sign
extension.

**Scope:** this is not a theorem for several independent rational bases. Recognition of the
ambient single-base condition and the coset construction require independent checking.

**Use:** reject any universality proposal confined to one `BS(1,q)`-type affine group.

**Next:** audit the stabilizer calculation, effective word construction, and transfer through
the index-two extension.
